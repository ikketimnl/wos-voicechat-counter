## ⚙️ Settings Menu (`/settings`)

The interactive settings panel lets you change everything without restarting:

- **Voice Generator** — switch between `local`, `espeak`, `festival`, `piper`, `console`
- **Count Direction** — toggle Count Down ↓ or Count Up ↑
- **Rally Intro** — enable or disable the opening announcement
- **Cache Controls** — clear countdown cache or full library cache to free disk space

All settings are saved immediately to `config/settings.json`.

## 🎵 Custom Audio Files

Replace the TTS voice with your own audio clips:

```
/audio upload   ← attach a file named:
  5.wav         → plays instead of TTS "5"
  intro.wav     → plays as the opening announcement
  complete.wav  → plays at the end
```

**Naming rules:** Use `<number>.wav` for numbers (e.g. `1.wav` through `200.wav`), or `intro.wav` / `complete.wav` for special phrases. Supported formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC. Max 5 MB per file.

Files are stored in `config/custom_audio/` (Docker volume-mounted, survives rebuilds).

## 🔊 Voice Generators

| Provider | Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Good | Auto-detects SAPI (Win), say (Mac), espeak (Linux) |
| `espeak` | Robotic | Fast, always available in Docker |
| `festival` | Better | Deeper voice, always available in Docker |
| `piper` | Natural | Neural TTS — requires extra install (see `DOCKER.md`) |
| `console` | None | Logs only — useful for testing without audio |

Switch between them live with `/settings`. The number library regenerates automatically and cached files from the old engine are cleaned up.

## 📋 Example Workflow

```
/join
/register Alpha 30
/register Beta  20
/register Gamma 10
/preview        ← check timing before launching
/launch         ← Bot speaks: "Alpha ready. Three. Two. One. Go.
                               [counts] 10... 9... 8... ATTACK!"
```

All three players arrive at the same second. 🎯
